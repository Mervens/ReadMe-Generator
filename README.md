## Description
What I have made is a README generator in JavaScript. It provides the user with a series of questions in the terminal, gathers the information and returns it in a new README.md file.

## How It Works

If this reposity is cloned, you will need to in your terminal use "cd Develop" to change to the Develop branch, then run node index.js to begin the prompts.
The README will be generated in the Develop folder.
